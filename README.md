**Description**

A weather forecast application that filters through a list of cities from all over the world (API generated) and returns forecast data about the next 3 upcoming days. The app provides a bookmark functionality in case you want to revisit the forecast later. With a funny twist, for my fellow mititei-obsessed romanians.

**Setup**

**1**  Go to https://www.weatherapi.com/, create an account and generate an API key


**2**  Create a `.env` file inside the root of the project.


**3**  Create a `API_KEY` environment variable and store your API key inside of it


**4**  Run `npm install`


**5**  Run `npm start`


**6** The app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000 "localhost:3000")
