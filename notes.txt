Suggestions for improving the app:

- needs an overall CSS rework and improved UI complexity
- the navbar should indicate the active page
- currently, the toast message generated by clicking the "add to bookmarks" button is displayed multiple times; ideally, it should only render once -
possible causes - toast container component;
- sometimes, after bookmarking several cards from several locations, the "add to bookmarks" button becomes disabled;
- bookmark sorting functionality would be a major improvement (sort bookmarks by date or location)
